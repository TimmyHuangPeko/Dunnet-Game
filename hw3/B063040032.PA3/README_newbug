hi, I found a bug that professor didn't mentioned before,
which may cause from problems to crashes of the program.
I think I've try my best to deal whith the bug, perhaps 
professor can give me a few bonus of my assignment to make
up the late submission of the first assignment.

The bug is I found is: if you drop the key inside the building,
permission of ~/PA2/start/e/e/ne/ne/ne would be changed 
to 600 and then made many commands be out of action, ex. 
n,s,w,e,l, and so on.
I have check how it react in dunnet, and do what the game
does.

----------------------------------------------------------------
So here's my solution.(Or you can find the full solution in my 
assignment with the comment #this is special)
In the case block 'drop', I add a flow control:


if( -f ~/A/key && `pwd -P | cut -d"/" -f1-3 --complement` !~ PA2/start/e/e/ne/ne/ne*) chmod 600 ~/PA2/start/e/e/ne/ne/ne


if you drop the key, the program will find out if you're inside
the building or not. And the permission will only change
if you're not inside the building. This can at least make
sure functionality of the commands.
But the permission still have to be changed if you drop 
the key in the building, so if you drop the key and then
leave the building without the key, the permission should
be changed to 600, and that make sense cause you don't
have the key to enter the building again.
So I also add a flow control in case '[nsew]':


else if ( $cmd[1] == s && `pwd -P | cut -d"/" -f1-3 --complement` == PA2/start/e/e/ne/ne/ne && !(-f ~/I/key) ) then
	    	cd `pwd -P`/$cmd[1]
	    	chmod 600 ~/PA2/start/e/e/ne/ne/ne #this is special
	    	see
	    	
	    	
if you leave the building -- command 's', the program
will find out whether there's key in the ~/I, if not,
the permission will be change to 600, make yourself
locked outside the building.
