Students asked questions about how the game should behave.
The answer is that, in almost every case, it should act like the game (the
other cases will be discussed below).


So I will go through the student questions and show what the game does for
each case...

******************************************************************************
Q1: "Your README file said that we can only climb the trees. Does that mean
     we can't climb the palm?"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A1: "No. The tree/palm/trees is all the same object (oddly, 'palms' is not).
     So you do what the game does. And we can learn what the game does by
     running it:"

Dead end
You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
from each other.
There is a shovel here.
>climb tree
You manage to get about two feet up the tree and fall back down.  You
notice that the tree is very unsteady.
>climb trees
You manage to get about two feet up the tree and fall back down.  You
notice that the tree is very unsteady.
>climb palm
You manage to get about two feet up the tree and fall back down.  You
notice that the tree is very unsteady.
>climb palms
I don't know what that object is.


******************************************************************************
Q2: "What should happen if I try to climb a tree where there isn't a tree
     (ie, anywhere except the first two locations)?"
Q3: "Should the game end if I eat the food?"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A2/3:"You do what the game does. And we can learn what the game does by
     running it:"

>e
E/W Dirt road
You are on the continuation of a dirt road.  There are more trees on
both sides of you.  The road continues to the east and west.
There is a large boulder here.
>climb tree
You manage to get about two feet up the tree and fall back down.  You
notice that the tree is very unsteady.
>e
Fork
You are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the
southeast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.
>climb tree
I don't see that here.
>se
SE/NW road
You are on a southeast/northwest road.
There is some food here.
>climb tree
I don't see that here.
>eat food
You don't have that.
>get food
Taken.  
>eat food
That tasted horrible.
>i
You currently have:
A lamp
>

As you see, you get an error message when you try to climb a tree that isn't
there, and the game didn't end when you ate the food.

>dig
I think you found something.
>get all
A computer board: Taken.  
>se
SE/NW road
You are on a southeast/northwest road.
There is some food here.
>get food
Taken.  
>se
Bear hangout
You are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the
northwest.
There is a ferocious bear here!
>sw
Hidden area
There is an emerald bracelet here.
>get emerald
Taken.  
>ne
Bear hangout
There is a ferocious bear here!
>i
You currently have:
A lamp
A shovel
A computer board
Some food
A bracelet
>shake lamp
Shaking a lamp seems to have no effect.
>shake shovel
Shaking a shovel seems to have no effect.
>shake cpu
Shaking a computer board seems to have no effect.
>shake food
Shaking some food seems to have no effect.
>shake emerald
Shaking a bracelet seems to have no effect.
>throw food
Done.
The bear takes the food and runs away with it. He left something behind.
>shake key
You don't have that.
>get key
Taken.  
>i
You currently have:
A lamp
A shovel
A computer board
A bracelet
A brass key
>shake key
Shaking a brass key seems to have no effect.
>se
You can't go that way.
>eat key
You forcefully shove a brass key down your throat, and start choking.

You are dead.
You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.

%

In the above, we see that eating anything except the food will kill you.
We also see that the message about what you are shoving down your throat
uses the same descriptions for objects as the "i" command does (except
that the first letter is not capitalized). Similarly, the shake messages
also use these same descriptions.
(As an additional observation from the above walkthrough, notice in the
above that moving "se" from the "Bear hangout" only kills you if the
bear is still there.)

>eat shovel
You forcefully shove a shovel down your throat, and start choking.

You are dead.

As we see, the game ignores extra arguments.


******************************************************************************
Q7: "Can I use aliases in my cshell script?"
A7: "Yes, you can. But the syntax of cshell aliases is a little different than
     for bash. The difference is that it uses a space instead of an =.


******************************************************************************
Q8: "I used google and found there are tricks with the '/dev/...' directory
     that might allow cshell to get the '2>' syntax. Can I use these tricks?"
A8: "No. (One reason to not allow it is that it isn't standard.)"
